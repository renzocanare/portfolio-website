                  The inspiration for this project came about when a friend and I spent over 3 hours comparing the prices of 100 individual cards across at least 6 different MTG hobby shops across Singapore.\

                  We decided that there had to be a faster way to do this instead of manually tabulating prices using Microsoft Excel and thus, this project was born.\
